**Project Title:** 6502 Assembly Name Color Display

**Description:**

This repository showcases a assignment completed as part of my CIIC4082 (Computer Architecture 2) course at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez. The project's objective was to use 6502 assembly to display my first and last name in an NES emulator, utilizing at least six distinct colors. 

**Acknowledgments:**

- The project was developed following a tutorial provided by NES Hacker (YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@NesHacker/featured). The tutorial guided us through the setup of 6502 assembly for NES programming and configuring an NES emulator to run custom code, resulting in the display of "Hello" in the emulator.

- The code's foundation was sourced from NES Hacker's repository (GitHub: https://github.com/NesHacker/DevEnvironmentDemo.git), and I further customized it to showcase my name in the desired colors.

- Additional insights and references for this project were drawn from the resource available at https://famicom.party/book/.

**Note:**

This project serves as both a learning experience and a demonstration of creative applications of 6502 assembly within the NES environment.
